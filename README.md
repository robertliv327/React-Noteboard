# lab3-robertliv327

For this lab, I completed all of the functional requirements and also added authentification for extra credit.

I split my app into a few components outside of index.js: create_bar (which contains the input fields and button that allow the user to create a new note), note (which holds one note), and notes_app (which contains the whole app). I had to break the app out into a component (notes_app) when I added in authentification, which is in index.js.

While doing the authentification, I had to pull some of the firebase logic into index.js, which Tim said was the right thing to do.

Extra credit: added authentification!
